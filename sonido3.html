<P><Center>MY LIFE</P></Center>
<p align="right"> I used to be a very shy student. Every day at school, I would sit quietly at the back of the classroom, hoping the teacher wouldn’t call on me. I was too nervous to raise my hand, even when I knew the answer. I often avoided group work and rarely spoke to my classmates. Being shy made it hard for me to enjoy school, and I sometimes felt like I didn’t belong.</p align="right"> 

<p align="left">But everything started to change when I made a few good friends. They were kind, patient, and always included me in conversations and activities. At first, I was still hesitant to speak, but they never gave up on me. They would gently encourage me to share my thoughts and would listen without judgment. Slowly, I began to open up, feeling a little more comfortable each day.</p align="left">

<P><Center>Their support made a big difference. They cheered me on when I participated in class for the first time, and they reminded me that it was okay to make mistakes. Because of them, I started to believe in myself. I learned that being quiet doesn’t mean I have nothing to say, and that my voice also matters. With their help, I began to build the confidence I never thought I had.</P></Center>

<p align="justify";>Now, I feel more comfortable speaking in front of others and working with classmates. I still have quiet moments, but I’m no longer afraid to be myself. I’ve realized that confidence doesn’t mean being loud—it means believing in who you are. Thanks to my friends, I’ve grown not just as a student, but also as a person</p align="justify">
